#Compiling mod_cfml.so

If you can't find a pre-compiled version of mod_cfml.so [here](builds/), please follow the instructions underneath.

##Compile for Mac and Linux

1. Get the source code from github: https://github.com/utdream/mod_cfml/archive/master.zip
    and extract into eg. `~/Documents/` (_a sub-folder "mod_cfml-master" will be created_)
2. Open a Terminal window, and enter:

    ```
    cd ~/Documents/mod_cfml-master/C
    sudo make
    sudo make install
    ```

3. The mod_cfml.so file can now be found in your Apache modules directory, by default at `/usr/libexec/apache2/mod_cfml.so`

##Compile for Windows

###Prerequisites

1.  Install Visual Studio. Make sure the Visual Studio version matches the version with which your Apache version is compiled. This is the "VC14" or "VC11" part. 
2. Download Apache 2.4
 - for Win32 into C:/Apache_x86 : https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
 - for Win64 into C:/Apache_x64 : https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
3. Download and install cMake: http://www.cmake.org/download/
 - Make sure `C:\Program Files (x86)\cMake\bin\` is in your PATH after install
4. Get the source code from github: https://github.com/utdream/mod_cfml/archive/master.zip
    and extract into `C:\modcfml\` (_a sub-folder "mod_cfml-master" will be created_)

### Compile for Win Apache httpd 32-bit

1. Open a Visual Studio **x86** command Prompt, "_VS2013 **x86** Native Tools Command Prompt_". Mine was in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\Shortcuts\`
2. In the command window, enter:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:/Apache_x86 -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo C:/modcfml/mod_cfml-master/C
    nmake && nmake install
    ```

3. The newly created mod_cfml.so can be found in `C:/Apache_x86/modules/`

### Compile for Win Apache httpd 64-bit

1. Open a Visual Studio **x64** command Prompt, "_VS2013 **x64** Native Tools Command Prompt_".
   Mine was in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\Shortcuts\`
2. In the prompt, enter:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=c:/Apache_x64 -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo C:/modcfml/mod_cfml-master/C
    nmake && nmake install
    ```

3. The newly created mod_cfml.so can be found in `C:/Apache_x64/modules/`
