# mod_cfml
Mod_cfml is a community-driven suite of programs that automatically configures Tomcat hosts to match hosts created in Apache or IIS. Mod_cfml removes the need to configure web sites twice - once in your web server and again in Tomcat - and performs this task automatically for you.

### Official Site

Installation and Configuration documentation can be found on the mod_cfml site here:

[http://viviotech.github.io/mod_cfml/](http://viviotech.github.io/mod_cfml/)

Note that the previous modcfml.org site has been depreciated in favor of the GitHub site in order to better facilitate community contributions and updates.

### Compiling the Apache module
See [C/README.md](C/README.md) for instructions.
